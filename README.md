# trivial-loop-array

Trivially constructible, destructible and copyable fixed-capacity looped array.

Please note that this class is not *yet* intended to be complete. Instead, I've tried to keep it is as simple as possible and implement only what I needed in my other projects.

If you find this useful and would like to improve it, please send a pull request. Contributions are welcome!
